import axios from "axios";

//variable initialized as empty string
 const[name,setName] = useState('')

 // name we use to get specific pokemon from api call
 const pokemon = "mewtwo" 


 //use this to make an API call , then whatever comes back from that call 
  axios.get(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemon}`).then(res=>setName(res.data.name))
  

  // res is equal to whatever came from the API call, is now temporarily stored as 'res' for us to decide what to do
  // res=> console.log(res) will console log that data so we can see what it contains and decide exactly what we want
  // setName(res) will store the data coming from the API in our own variable for us to use.
  // my commenting fucking sucks so I apoligize , I hope it makes sense.
